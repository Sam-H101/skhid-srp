//! The one-time restore of the game's `resources.db`
//! (`client/updater/README.md`, "Restoring resources.db";
//! `updater_logic::resources`): the regions an earlier updater rewrote in
//! place, as its record beside the updater names them, get their stock
//! bytes back, after the overlay and before the patch step. Once the record
//! is empty this step does nothing but look for its file.
//!
//! For one region:
//!
//! 1. Its bytes are hashed (the file may be open in the game meanwhile).
//!    The stock bytes, a db of another size (another build) or none: the
//!    record of it goes. Else:
//! 2. The db is opened by this program alone (share mode 0) and closed
//!    again: a game that runs holds it, and nothing is changed this run.
//! 3. The stock bytes come from the copy the earlier updater kept
//!    (`updater_skhid.backup\<original sha256>`) when it checks, else from
//!    `<site>/resources/<original sha256>` into `updater_skhid.cache\`
//!    (streamed to the disk, its size and SHA-256 checked).
//! 4. The region is journalled (`updater_skhid.resources.journal`, flushed),
//!    the db opened by this program alone, the bytes written at the
//!    region's offset, flushed, read back and checked; then the journal goes
//!    and the region leaves the record.
//!
//! Best effort: whatever fails is logged and tried again at the next start
//! (the record stays); it never fails the update. The patches mount over
//! the db, so a region not restored yet is hidden wherever a patch has
//! that file. Once the record is empty, the record, the copies kept and the
//! cache are deleted.
