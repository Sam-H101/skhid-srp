"""The play area a native HUD minimap bitmap shows, as a boolean mask of a
W x W frame (the bitmap covers the same square frame as the render).

Three kinds of bitmap, told apart by their alpha (kind_of):
  "alpha" (the 0.26g maps): the play area is opaque and the rest clear, so
    the area is alpha > 0.15.
  "alpha:<t>" (London): the bitmap fades out in a soft vignette around a more
    opaque play area; t is the valley of its alpha histogram (0.4).
  "line" (the 0.11e ports): opaque everywhere with a blurred edge, the play
    area outlined by a drawn light-grey line; the area is what that line
    encloses (the line's gaps closed by 2 px).
